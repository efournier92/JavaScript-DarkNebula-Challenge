#JavaScript Dark Nebula Challenge

This is a suite of logic problems I did to expand my knowledge of JavaScript syntax.

All credit goes to Rebecca Murphey, who authored this exercise to test potential job applicants on their JavaScript ability.

This suite covers the following areas of JS knowledge:
* Arrays
* Best Practices
* Functions
* Objects
* Recursion
* Regex
* Strings

**See files in the `app` folder for my solutions**

##Dependencies
* Node
	* `brew install node`

##Setup Instructions
```
npm install
npm start
```
